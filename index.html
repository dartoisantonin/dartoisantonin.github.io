        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my Portfolio. I am currently a <b>Game Design</b> student at Supinfogame RUBIKA. During my formation I am working on several projects, some of which I would like to share with you.

            Here you will find all types of games, video, role-play, even an alternative controller. <br/><br/>
            
            I have some programming knowledge in C#, using Unity and visual studio, but those are not my main skills.

            My work has been mainly focusing on game design, creating <b>mechanics</b>, <b>systems</b>, <b>games's economies</b>, <b>level design</b> and <b>analysis</b>. <br/><br/>
            
            I had a first professional experience as a <b>Quality Assurance tester</b> for Anuman Interactive, a Parisian video game editor working alongside Microids.
            
            In the future I would be glad to professionally work on systems, games's economies or even <b>monetization</b>.
            
            I have an economic background with a diploma in <b>economic and social sciences</b> [the french baccalaur√©at], I was always interested in finance. I am currently documenting myself on the subject, F2P and cosmetics being my main source of study as a growing number of games are now relying on them.
            
            I am currently working on a mobile game as a Lead Game Designer and also Monetization Designer, this project is bringing me a lot of knowledge that I hope will come in handy in a future job. <br/><br/>
            
            Thanks for reading and I wish you a good visit !
            </p>
