        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my Portfolio. I am currently a Game Designer student at Supinfogame RUBIKA. During my formation I am working on several projects, some of which I would like to share with you.

            Here you will find all types of games, video, role-play, even an alternative controller.
            
            My work has been mainly focusing on game design, creating mechanics, systems, economy, level design and analysis.
            
            I have also some programming knowledge, using Unity and visual studio, but those are not my main skills.
            
            I had a first professional experience as a Quality Assurance tester for Anuman Interactive, a Parisian video game editor working alongside Microids. In the future I would be glad to work on systems, game economies or even monetization. I have an economic background with an Economy diplomat and I was always interested in finance. I am currently documenting myself on the subject, F2P and cosmetics being my main source of study as a growing number of games are now relying on them.
            
            I am currently working on a mobile game as a Lead Game Designer and also Monetization Designer, this project is bringing me a lot of knowledge that I hope will come in handy in a future job.
            
            Thanks for reading and I wish you a good visit !
